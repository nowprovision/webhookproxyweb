# WebHookProxy Web Frontend

## Introduction

This is the web frontend and server that works with for multi-tenant webhookproxy.com saas 
[webhookproxy-saas](http://www.github.com/nowprovision/webhookproxy-saas) 
that uses the backend library [webhookproxy](http://www.github.com/nowprovision/webhookproxy).

All open source.

This uses clojurescript, re-agent, and re-frame on the frontend, and clojure, ring, compojure 
on the backend. A small amount of cljc to facilitate schema sharing is also used.

## Disclaimer

A lot of stuff isn't optimal, I am well aware. Minimal viable product. 

PRs, code reviews welcome, contributions will be noted.
